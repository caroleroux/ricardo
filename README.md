code sample for REST api 

# author : Carole Roux
I'm a senior software engineer, specialized HMI architectures.
I've been working on building APIs for frameworks and components, using UML, for 19 years.
I've been developping mostly on embedded systems for almost 13 years, at the middleware and application levels.
This high constrained environment trained me on high quality code and rigorous methodology in development and delivery.

# content description
This repository contains the code for comparing products, users or companies.
the API provides the functionality to compare a list of objects of the same category with a list of criterias, and also to compare a list of objects of the same category, with a maximum number of best matching criterias.

The identified business objects are Person/User, Product and Company, while the identified criterias are the price, the evaluation mark, the availability, the delivery delay, the shipment delay, the delivery point, the ergonomy, the design, the quality price evaluation mark, the weight, the size, the color...

There is another comparison to do wich is also to find a list of objects that match the criteria : color of the product = blue, size of the product = 37
